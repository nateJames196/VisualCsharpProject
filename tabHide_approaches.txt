To hide tabs;event listener approach:
- Store an integer value representing the currently selected tab.
- Add an eventlistener for the TabIndexChanged event
- When the event is triggered, change the currently selected tab back to the stored integer value
- Whenever the tab is MEANT to change, change the stored integer value with it
- May cause an ugly *blink* to occur


To hide tabs;Removal approach:
- Make sure all tabPages are stored in variables
- Get the collection of tabPages inside the tabControl, using tabControl.TabPages
- Call the "Remove" method on the collection, using the page you want to "hide" as the argument.
- This hides the tab. To show the tab again, grab the collection of tab pages in tabControl again (tabControl.tabPages)
- Add the new page using the the "Add" method on the collection, using the page you want to "show" as an argument.
